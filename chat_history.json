You're looking for a design vision for a SaaS web app focused on visualizing and managing company ownership structures, targeting startup founders and VCs. The key is to move away from traditional spreadsheet-like interfaces and embrace a modern, intuitive, and highly visual experience. Here's a plan for the initial prototype:\n\nFeatures for the First Version:\n\n- Dashboard: A visually appealing snapshot of the ownership structure. This will likely involve a pie chart or stacked bar chart to represent the distribution of ownership among investors, founders, and employees.\n- Cap Table View: A clear and concise table-style list of all shareholders, including their percentage ownership, number of shares, and the type of instrument they hold (equity, option pool, etc.).\n- Scenario Simulator: A tool that allows users to input financing rounds and instantly visualize the resulting dilution changes. This should be highly interactive, potentially using sliders and dynamic charts.\n\nDesign Elements:\n\n- Colors:\n    - Base color: Light gray or off-white for a clean background.\n    - Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    - Accent colors: A primary brand color (e.g., a shade of blue or green) for interactive elements and highlights, and a secondary accent color (e.g., a lighter shade of the primary color) for subtle visual cues.\n- Typography:\n    - Use modern, clean fonts like Inter, Roboto, or Open Sans for a professional and readable look.\n    - Font sizes should be carefully chosen to ensure clarity and hierarchy.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-28T07:51:09.274276"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a modern SaaS ownership management app!
